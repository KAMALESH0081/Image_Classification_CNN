# 🌾 Rice Image Classification with CNN

A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from scratch to classify images of five different rice types.  
The model is lightweight (~1 million parameters) and trained on a dataset of 5,000 labeled rice images.

## 📁 Project Structure

The entire workflow — including data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation — is implemented within a Jupyter Notebook for simplicity and transparency.

Python modules (`model.py`, `train.py`, etc.) have been scaffolded and will be populated in future updates to support a modular, production-ready pipeline.

> 🔧 Until then, please refer to the notebook for the complete working implementation.
